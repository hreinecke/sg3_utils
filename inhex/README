        Hex data for various sg3_utils utilities
        ========================================

The files in this folder contain hexadecimal data (in ASCII) and associated
comments (prefixed with the hash mark symbol ('#')).

The utility that each hex file is associated with can be determined by
prepending "sg_" to these filenames then going to the 'src' folder (a
sibling folder to this one) and look for a match or partial match on
the name.

For example:
    vpd_dev_id.hex
after prepending 'sg_' becomes:
    sg_vpd_dev_id.hex
which is a partial match on the sg_vpd utility.
The remaining 'dev_id.hex' is meant to suggest the 'device identifier'
VPD page which is a mandatory VPD page.

Assuming sg3_utils is installed, it can be tested like this:
    sg_vpd --inhex=<folder_holding_sg3_utils>/inhex/vpd_dev_id.hex

And should output this:

Device Identification VPD page:

Users are encouraged to send the author any ASCII hex files for utilities
that support --inhex and don't have hex data already. Special cases are
also welcome. They help the author test this code.
