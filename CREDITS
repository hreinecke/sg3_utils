The author of sg3_utils would like to thank the following people who
have made contributions:

	by Joerg Schilling). isosize is now found in the util-linux
	package and in the archive directory of this package.

	sg_readcap, sg_reset, sg_scan, sg_start, sg_test_rwbuf,
	sg_turs and sginfo

Eric Youngdale <eric@andante.org> author of scsi_info on which sginfo
	is based.

F. Jansen: additions to sg_scan

Heiko Eissfeldt <heiko@colossus.escape.de> sg based example programs for
	the original sg driver

Kurt Garloff <garloff@suse.de> original sg_start and sg_test_rwbuf.
	Additions to sginfo and sg_map.

Martin Schwenke <martin@meltin.net> added the raw switch "-r" to sg_inq

Peter Allworth <linsol@zeta.org.au> original dd clone design used by
	sg3_utils's dd variants (e.g. sg_dd).
