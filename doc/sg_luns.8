.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send the SCSI REPORT LUNS command to the \fIDEVICE\fR and outputs the
response. In the SPC\-3 SCSI standard support for this command is mandatory.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-decode\fR
decode logical unit numbers into their hierarchical parts. Interprets
luns as described in SAM\-3 when the HiSup bit is set in a
standard INQUIRY's response.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output response to this command in ASCII hex.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maxlen\fR=\fILEN\fR
where \fILEN\fR is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in
the cdb's "allocation length" field. If not given (or \fILEN\fR is zero)
then 8192 is used. The maximum allowed value of \fILEN\fR is 65536.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
output ASCII hex rendering of each report lun, one per line.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output response in binary (to stdout).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR=\fISR\fR
this option sets the 'select report' field (\fISR\fR) in the SCSI REPORT
LUNS command. The default value is 0. When 0 is given (or this option is
not specified) then the \fIDEVICE\fR should yield a list of luns addressable
via this "I_T nexus" that use the following lun addressing methods: logical
unit addressing, peripheral device addressing and flat space addressing.
When 1 is given the \fIDEVICE\fR should yield a list of only "well known"
logical units addressable via this "I_T" nexus. When 2 is given the
\fIDEVICE\fR should yield all luns addressable via this "I_T" nexus.
To simplify, for the I_T nexus associated with the \fIDEVICE\fR, the
meanings of the \fISR\fR values are:
.br
  \fB0\fR : all luns excluding well known logical units
.br
  \fB1\fR : well known logical units
.br
  \fB2\fR : all luns
.br
Values greater than 2 are reserved (at SPC\-4 (rev 8)).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_luns is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
