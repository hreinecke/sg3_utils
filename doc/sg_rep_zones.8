[\fI\-\-readonly\fR] [\fI\-\-report=OPT\fR] [\fI\-\-start=LBA\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SCSI REPORT ZONES command to \fIDEVICE\fR and outputs the data
returned. This command is found in the ZBC draft standard whose most
recent revision is 1a.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response in hexadecimal to stdout. When used once the whole
response is output in ASCII hexadecimal with a leading address (starting at
0) on each line. When used twice each zone descriptor in the response is
output separately in hexadecimal. When used thrice the whole response is
output in hexadecimal with no leading address (on each line).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maxlen\fR=\fILEN\fR
where \fILEN\fR is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in
the cdb's "allocation length" field. If not given (or \fILEN\fR is zero)
then 8192 is used. The maximum allowed value of \fILEN\fR is 1048576.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output the SCSI response (i.e. the data-out buffer) in binary (to stdout).
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\fR
open the \fIDEVICE\fR read\-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).
The default is to open it read\-write.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-report\fR=\fIOPT\fR
where \fIOPT\fR will become the contents of the REPORTING OPTION field
in the cdb. The default value is 0 which means report a list or all zones.
Some other values are 1 for list full zones; 2 for list all open zones; 3
for list all empty zones; 4 for list all read only zones; 5 for list all
offline zones; and 6 for list all zones with the RESET bit set.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR=\fILBA\fR
where \fILBA\fR is a zone start logical block address (LBA) of the first
zone to be reported. The default value is 0. \fILBA\fR must be a zone
start LBA otherwise an ILLEGAL REQUEST sense key is returned. Assumed to be
in decimal unless prefixed with '0x' or has a trailing 'h' which indicate
hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_rep_zones is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
