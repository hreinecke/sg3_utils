.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send the SCSI GET LBA STATUS(16) or GET LBA STATUS(32) command to the
\fIDEVICE\fR and outputs the response. The 16 byte command variant was
introduced in (draft) SBC\-3 revision 20 and devices that support logical
block provisioning should support this command. The GET LBA STATUS(32)
command was added in (draft) SBC\-4 revision 14.
.PP
The default action is to decode the response into one LBA status descriptor
per line output to stdout. The descriptor LBA is output in hex (prefixed
by '0x') and the number of blocks is output in decimal followed by the
provisioning status and additional status in decimal. The provisioning status
can be in the range 0 to 15 of which only 0 (mapped or unknown), 1 (unmapped),
2 (anchored), 3 (mapped) and 4 (unknown) are used currently. The amount of
output can be reduced by the \fI\-\-brief\fR option.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-16\fR
send SCSI GET LBA STATUS(16) command which is the 16 byte variant. In the
absence of the \fI\-\-16\fR or the \fI\-\-32\fR options the SCSI GET LBA
STATUS(16) command is sent. If both \fI\-\-16\fR and the \fI\-\-32\fR options
are given then the GET LBA STATUS(16) command is sent.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-32\fR
send SCSI GET LBA STATUS(32) command which is the 32 byte variant. When
given together with the \fI\-\-16\fR option then this option is ignored (so
the GET LBA STATUS(16) command is sent).
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-brief\fR
when use once then one LBA status descriptor per line is output to stdout.
Each line has this
format: "0x<descriptor_LBA>  0x<blocks> <provisioning_status>
<additional_status>". So the descriptor's starting LBA and number of blocks
are output in hex while the provisioning status and additional status are
in decimal. When used twice (e.g. '\-bb' or '\-\-brief \-\-brief') then the
provisioning status of the given \fILBA\fR (or LBA 0 if the \fI\-\-lba\fR
option is not given) is output to stdout. A check is made that the given
\fILBA\fR lies in the range of the first returned LBA status descriptor (as
it should according to SBC\-3 revision 20) and warnings are sent to stderr
if it doesn't.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-element\-id\fR=\fIEI\fR
where \fIEI\fR is the element identifier of the physical element for which
the LBAs shall be reported based on the value in the report type field (i.e.
\fIRT\fR). This option is only active with the SCSI GET LBA STATUS(32)
command (i.e. it is ignored if the GET LBA STATUS(16) command is sent).
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output response to this command in ASCII hex.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lba\fR=\fILBA\fR
where \fILBA\fR is the starting Logical Block Address (LBA) to check the
provisioning status for. Note that the \fIDEVICE\fR chooses how many
following blocks that it will return provisioning status for.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maxlen\fR=\fILEN\fR
where \fILEN\fR is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in
the cdb's "allocation length" field. If not given then 24 is used. 24 is
enough space for the response header and one LBA status descriptor.
\fILEN\fR should be 8 plus a multiple of 16 (e.g. 24, 40, and 56 are suitable).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output response in binary (to stdout).
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\fR
open the \fIDEVICE\fR read\-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).
The default is to open it read\-write.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-report\-type\fR=\fIRT\fR
where \fIRT\fR is 0 for report all LBAs; 1 for report LBAs using non\-zero
provisioning status; 2 for report LBAs that are mapped; 3 for report LBAs
that are de-allocated; 4 for report LBAs that are anchored; 5 for report
LBAs that may return an unrecovered error. The REPORT TYPE field was added
to the GET LBA STATUS cdb in sbc4r12.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\-len\fR=\fISL\fR
where \fISL\fR is the scan length which is the maximum number of contiguous
logical blocks to be scanned for logical blocks that meet the given report
type (i.e. \fIRT\fR). This option is only active with the SCSI GET LBA
STATUS(32) command (i.e. it is ignored if the GET LBA STATUS(16) command is
sent).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output). Additional output
caused by this option is sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
In SBC\-3 revision 25 the calculation associated with the Parameter Data
Length field in the response was modified. Prior to that the byte offset
was 8 and in revision 25 it was changed to 4.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_get_lba_status is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise
