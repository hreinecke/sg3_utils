[\fI\-\-help\fR] [\fI\-\-hex\fR] [\fI\-\-list_id=ID\fR] [\fI\-\-verbose\fR]
[\fI\-\-version\fR] [\fI\-\-xfer_len=BTL\fR] \fIDEVICE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
This utility is designed to query the status of the SCSI Extended Copy
facility (see SPC\-3 revision 23 sections 6.3 and 6.17), present in
some modern storage arrays. This utility sends a SCSI RECEIVE COPY
RESULTS command to the given \fIDEVICE\fR and displays the response.
.PP
The command has four distinct modes of operation, distinguished by
the service action field:
.TP
\fBCOPY STATUS\fR
Displays the current status of the EXTENDED COPY command identified by
the list id field.
.TP
\fBRECEIVE DATA\fR
Return the held data read by the EXTENDED COPY command identified by
the list id field. This option is only meaningful if the respective
segment descriptor are supported.
.TP
\fBOPERATING PARAMETERS\fR
Return copy manager operating parameters. This option is also useful
to determine if the SCSI Extended Copy facility is supported.
.TP
\fBFAILED SEGMENT DETAILS\fR
Return copy target device sense data and other information about any
failed segments.

.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-failed\fR
sets the service action field to FAILED SEGMENT DETAILS [4].
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
prints out the response buffer in hex.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list_id\fR=\fIID\fR
sets the list identifier field to \fIID\fR (default: 0).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-params\fR
sets the service action field to OPERATING PARAMETERS [3].
This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-receive\fR
sets the service action field to RECEIVE DATA [1].
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
sets the service action field to COPY STATUS [0].
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xfer_len\fR=\fIBTL\fR
sets the allocation length field to \fIBTL\fR. It is the byte transfer
length and is the maximum (byte) size of the response. \fIBTL\fR must be
less than 10000 and defaults to 520.
.SH NOTES
Decoding of \fIRECEIVE DATA\fR service action is not implemented.
.SH EXAMPLES
Query the operating parameters for a device:
.PP
# sg_copy_results \-p /dev/sdo
.br
Receive copy results (report operating parameters):
    Supports no list identifier: no
    Maximum target descriptor count: 2
    Maximum segment descriptor count: 1
    Maximum descriptor list length: 92 bytes
    Maximum segment length: 33553920 bytes
    Inline data not supported
    Held data limit: 0 bytes
    Maximum stream device transfer size: 0 bytes
    Total concurrent copies: 0
    Maximum concurrent copies: 255
    Data segment granularity: 512 bytes
    Inline data granularity: 1 bytes
    Held data granularity: 1 bytes
    Implemented descriptor list:
        Segment descriptor 0x02: Copy from block device to block device
        Target descriptor 0xe4: Identification descriptor

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_copy_results is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
