Building files in this directory depends on several files being already
built in the ../lib directory. So to build files here, the ./configure
needs to be executed in the parent directory followed by changing
directory to the lib directory and calling 'make' there.
Another way is to do a top level 'make' after the ./configure which
will make the libraries followed by all the utilities in the src/
directory.

There is an brief explanation of each example in the README file in
the main (i.e. this directory's parent) directory. There are also
some notes at the top of each source file.

The sg_chk_asc utility decodes the SCSI additional sense code table
found at http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.txt and checks it against
the table found in sg_lib_data.c in the lib/ subdirectory. It is
designed to keep the table in sg_lib_data.c in "sync" with the
table at the t10.org web site.

The tst_sg_lib utility exercises several functions found in sg_lib.c
and related files in the 'lib' sibling directory. Use 'tst_sg_lib -h'
to get more information.

Those files with the extension "cpp" are C++ examples that use facilities
in C++11. They can be built by calling 'make -f Makefile.cplus'. A
gcc/g++ compiler of 4.7.3 vintage or later will be required.
